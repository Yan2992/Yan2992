# Hi (Person interested in my story) 👋 I'm Yan!

---

I started learning to code in **2025** on my own because I wanted to **change careers and start making things that really matter**. I love a good challenge 💡, and I realized I knew how to do many things, but didn’t have something I was truly *good at*. So, I thought: why not try software engineering?  

It’s been (and still is) **hard**, but from time to time I get that **“Aha” moment**, and that’s the high I live for in this industry—the moment your brain connects the dots after weeks of feeling like a dumb dumb 🤯. That feeling? Priceless.

## 🌱 Learning & Growth

2-3 years ago, the old me would have said: *“Nah, man, learning this stuff is boring. Play video games, go out, have fun.”*  

Now, I can proudly tell the old me: **I’m finally where I need to be.** I found my flow: **solving challenges**, whether coding, puzzles, or life. This is what keeps my brain firing on all cylinders 🚀.
